# DBM for Warmane-Icecrown

Core addon backport from retail by Barsoomx: (https://github.com/Barsoomx/DBM-wowcircle).

This version aims to deliver more accurate timers and features from retail to Warmane-Icecrown server raids.

# HOW TO INSTALL

**Disclaimer: If you have used DBM before, you will need to do a clean install before using this version since this is a retail backport and therefore it is not compatible with 2010's version of DBM. To do this:**
1. On your addons folder (Interface/Addons), select every DBM folder (everything that starts with DBM-) and **delete** them.
2. On your SavedVariables folder (WTF/Account/[AccountName]/SavedVariables), select every DBM file (everything that starts with DBM-) and **delete** them. **THIS STEP WILL REMOVE YOUR DBM CONFIGURATIONS/PROFILES!**


**With no remnants of old DBM files we are now ready to start the installation process.**

1. Download the master branch from this repository (https://github.com/Zidras/DBM-Icecrown/archive/refs/heads/master.zip).
2. Extract the contents of the zip file to your addons folder (Interface/Addons)
